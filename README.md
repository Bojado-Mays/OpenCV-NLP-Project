# OpenCV-NLP-Project

## About the Project
For this project we will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. We choose to scrape data over OpenCV repos across Github. 

## Goals
The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.


## Deliverables
- A well-documented jupyter notebook that contains your analysis
- One or two google slides suitable for a general audience that summarize your findings. Include a well-labelled visualization in your slides.

## Project Steps
### Acquire
- Data is aquired from the fitbit-data files.
- The functions are stored in the acquire.py file.
- File is a reproducible component for gathering the data.

### Prepare
- Created a prepare.py file. 
- Data is split into train, validate, and test. 
- Data is scaled as necessary.
- Missing values are investigated and handled.
- Outliers are investigated and handled.
- File is a reproducible component that handles missing values, outliers, and changes in data types. 

### Explore
- Summarized your takeaways and conclusions.  

### Model

### Conclusion

### Future Investigations

## How to Reproduce
All files are reproducible and available for download and use.
- [x] Read this README.md
- [ ] Download the aquire.py, prepare.py, and Final_Report.ipynb files
