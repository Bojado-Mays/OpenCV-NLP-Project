# OpenCV-NLP-Project

## About the Project
For this project we will be scraping data from GitHub repository README files. We choose to scrape data over OpenCV repos across Github. 

## Goals
Our goal is to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.


## Deliverables
- A well-documented Jupyter Notebook that contains your analysis.
- One or two google slides suitable for a general audience that summarize your findings. Include a well-labelled visualization in your slides.


## Data Dictionary
| Feature | Definition |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

| Repo              | A directory or storage space for your projects. Code, text, or image files are stored. |  
| Language          | Refers to programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. |
| Readme Contents   | A README file contains information about other files in a directory or archive of computer software, it is usually a simple plain text file. |
| OpenCV            | (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel).|  
| NLP               | (Natural Language Processing) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. |  


## Project Steps
### Acquire
- Data is aquired from 150 different (most starred) repos over the topic of OpenCV.
- The functions are stored in the acquire.py file.
- File is a reproducible component for gathering the data.

### Prepare
- Created a prepare.py file. 
- Missing values are investigated and handled.
- File is a reproducible component that handles missing values and changes in data types. 

### Explore
- Summarized your takeaways and conclusions.  

### Model

### Conclusion

### Future Investigations

## How to Reproduce
All files are reproducible and available for download and use.
- [x] Read this README.md
- [ ] Download the aquire.py, prepare.py, and Final_Report.ipynb files
